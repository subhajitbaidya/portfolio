# My Professional Portfolio

Simple portfolio website for showcasing my work. I have used HTML CSS and Javascript to design this static website. It does not have a backend as it is not currently required.
I have hosted it using Github Pages for continous changes to update on the main website and keeping the deployment easy.

Feel free to clone it if you like the minimalistic design 😊
